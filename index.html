  <h1>Privacy Policy for Test Automation App</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> <?php echo date('Y-m-d'); ?></p>

  <p>
    This test application is created and operated solely by <strong>Usama Sheikh (usamasheikh384@gmail.com)</strong> 
    for personal learning and experimentation with Instagram and Facebook automation workflows.
    The app is not connected to any company, business, or agency. 
  </p>

  <h2>1. Purpose of This App</h2>
  <p>
    This app exists only for educational and testing purposes to understand how Facebook/Instagram API 
    integrations and workflow automations function (e.g., through platforms like n8n).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information I Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic public profile information required by Facebook/Instagram APIs for authentication.</li>
    <li>Your email address <strong>(only my own email: usamasheikh384@gmail.com)</strong> for testing login flows.</li>
    <li>Non-sensitive automation metadata generated during workflow testing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How the Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>
    Any data retrieved through the API is used ONLY to test and run automation workflows.
    No data is used for marketing, analytics, advertising, or shared with anyone.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    No data is sold, shared, or transferred to any third parties. 
    All collected data remains private and is used only locally for experimentation.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Since this is a single-user test app, you (Usama) may delete all data anytime. 
    You can request deletion by emailing yourself at 
    <strong>usamasheikh384@gmail.com</strong>, and all testing data will be removed within 48 hours.
